Temporary information on the workings of the interrupt handler.

fn_request_handler_k (Only for kernel)
Stores A as the signal handler address for this interrupt, then returns the interrupt to be used in A.
The kernel should then tell the hardware to raise interrupts with message A.
It is usually preferable to use a seperate handler for hardware.

When an interrupt comes in, the interrupt handler will JSR to the corresponding signal handler with A still the same as the hardware just set when interrupting.
