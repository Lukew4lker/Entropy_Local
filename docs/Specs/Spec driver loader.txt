							the loader for all drivers in Entropy							General:	This document aims to sppecify the tasks, an driver loader has to fulfill.	Since the amount of peripherals for an DCPU can vary, drivers can't be loaded fix into the OS.	They need to be loaded one by one, and each assigned to an specific device.	Thus, they will need an standart Interface per device group (interchangability) and must be relocatable by nature.	The initial floppy driver is something special, howether.Initial floppy driver:	As it is already loaded, the standart driver will just add it in an appropiate Place in the device and driver Table.	It needs acces to the corresponding driver location and hardware number.	It won't dare to relocate it.	Yet it still has to provide the standart driver Interface.Standard drivers:	Will being loaded accordingly to some translation table.	Have to be placed in /drv on the OS floppy. 	Driver must have an .get_hardware_class funtion at Offset 1 in the function Table.Driver Table:	The loader will create an driver Table, so other processes can easily acess the drives.	One row per driver.	The loader also loads the correct driver into the ram, handles neccessary label relocations and malloc.	the Loader calls the init function so the drivers can initialize their hardware. 		Layout (row):		+----------+----+--------------------------------------------------------------+		|Offset    |size|contains/purpose                                              |		+----------+----+--------------------------------------------------------------+		|0x0       |1   |the corresponding hardware number                             |		|0x1       |2   |man ID, little endian                                         |		|0x3       |2   |dev ID, little endian                                         |		|0x5       |1   |hardware version                                              |		|0x6       |1   |device class                                                  |		|0x7       |1   |ptr to driver function table                                  |		+----------+----+--------------------------------------------------------------+
