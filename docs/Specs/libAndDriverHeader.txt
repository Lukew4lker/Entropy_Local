The library and driver header file goes at the end, so this file
will give word positions relative to the end of the file:

WORD:            Function:
0                header size (include this word!)
-1               lib header version number (see below)
-2               lib ID/pointer to driver hardware ID func(see below)
-3               lib version number
-4               length of relocation table
-5               relocation table (see below)
-pastRelocTable  function table (see below)

VERSION NUMBERS:
Lib header versions start at 1, whilst drivers start at 0xFFFF

RELOCATION TABLE:
If you reference ANY memory location, you have to relocate it.
To do so, you surround it with .longform and .shortform, and
precede with a label, like so:

.longform
:lib_STDIO_RELOC55 SET C, [lib_STDIO_Projector_StackPos]
.shortform

When placing the label inside the relocation table, there's
some rules that you have to remember:

For a JSR statement, relocate like so:
dat lib_STDIO_RELOC36+1

FOR SET, ADD, and SUB (at least)
Assuming :RELOC11 SET A, [0xBEEF]
dat RELOC11+1

Assuming :RELOC12 SET [0xBEEF], A
dat RELOC12+2

FUNCTION TABLE
This is just dat statements of the functions in the lib
example:
dat lib_STDIO_init
dat lib_STDIO_getChar
...

YOU DO NOT NEED TO RELOCATE FUNCTIONS, THE LIB LOADER DOES IT!

HARDWARE ID:
This is a (non-relocated) memory address of the function that
returns the hardware ID that the driver handles.
